1. Create a new git repo in GitHub. Name the repo using your name (first, last or chosen) and 'ad320'. My repo, for instance, would be 'panzer-ad320'. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo (Links to an external site.)

2. Clone the repository to your computer

3. Use Create React App to create a new react project called 'client' inside your git repo folder

4. Run the app for the first time. make sure it loads and displays the stock create react app view

5. Referring to the wireframe linked in the module, create components that display only static data. These components do not need to respond to user interaction or load content dynamically. Make your best effort to replicate the components using the least repetition possible.

6. Create your own color palette for the react app.
